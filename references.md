# Back to the Loonaverse

## Pygame Installation
This project's GUI and event listeners are managed by the *pygame* module. The installation guide can be found on their
[wiki page](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). Most users can start with this command:

```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

Run this example code to test installation:
```
python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
```

## Quick start guide
* Run the file *main.py* from the command line
* Enter your player name
    * This will be used to record your score
* Instruction screen will appear.
    * Press *return* to start the game
    * Use the arrows keys to move the spaceship and spacebar to shoot bullets
* Rack up points by staying alive and avoiding the aliens. Shoot the aliens with bullets
to score more points
* The game will end when the player is hit by an alien
* Your final score will be displayed on the screen
* The top 3 scores ever achieved in the game will be displayed
* Exit the game by clicking the "X" button at the top of the game window


## Mini-reflection
I completed most of what I envisioned for this project such as:
* Game objects
* Game loops that contains the multiple game objects, and the flow of the game
* Game menu to start the game
* Persistent score board

If I had more time to develop my game, I would like to better incorporate the Loona theme throughout the game. Notably,
I wish I had more time to allow for user customization by allowing players to take a quiz to see which member they
personify. Each member would have had their respective color, and this color would be reflected in the spaceship and 
bullets.

My greatest challenge was to understand the paradigm of *pygame* and how to use the module. Fortunately, *pygame* is a
popular game development tool, and I benefited greatly from online video lectures about *pygame*.
